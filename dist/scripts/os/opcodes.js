     The 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor that follows the memory oriented design philosophy of
     the Motorola 6800.  Several engineers left Motorola and formed MOS Technology which
     introduced the 6502 in 1975. The 6502 gained in popularity because of it's low price and
     became the heart of several early personal computers including the Apple II, Commodore 64,
     and Atari 400 and 800. The 6502 handles data in its registers, each of which holds one byte
     (8-bits) of data.
